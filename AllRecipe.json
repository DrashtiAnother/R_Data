To make the dumpling (momo) dough;  add the flour into a large mixing bowl, add a little water at a time to the flour and knead well to make a smooth and yet firm dough. We don't add the salt or oil to make the dumpling dough. Cover the dough and allow it to rest for about 20 minutes, till we get the filling ready.Next step is the make the filling for the dumplings. Heat the oil in a saucepan on medium heat.  Add the mushrooms, sprinkle some salt and stir fry on high heat until the mushroom become tender. Mushrooms release a lot of water, so stir-fry until all the moisture evaporates.Once the mushrooms are cooked and dry, allow it to cool. Once the mushrooms cool down, add it to a large bowl and combine it with the remaining filling ingredients including the oil. Our final step is to make the Mushroom DumplingsDivide the dough into small lemon sized portions of an inch in diameter. Dust the dough portions in flour and roll out into a circle. Don’t roll too thick, as the filling will push itself out and tear when steamed.Place a small spoon of filling in the center of the rolled circle. Bring together the edges of the dough with a pinching and folding motion on one side and bring the other side to hold to the pinched side. By doing this, the half moon shaped momos (dumplings) will have a frilled look. Proceed the similar way with the remaining dough.As you keep shaping the dumplings (momos) you need to keep them on a greased platter and cover with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out.While you are shaping the dumplings (momos), keep a steamer with water boiling. Grease the steamer pan with some oil to prevent the momos from sticking.Place the shaped dumplings (momos) on the greased steamer pan. So when you have one set of shaped dumplings, place them in the steamer and steam on high for 5 to 7 minutes until you see a glaze on the skin. Serve the Mushroom Dumplings along with a hot and spicy Homemade Red Chilli Garlic Sauce Recipe as a tea time snack or as an appetizer for parties with Chinese Vegetable Dry Manchurian Balls Recipe.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Bengali Sita Bhog, we will first make a rice and chena vermicelli. You can either use a wide holed grater or a sev maker to make the vermicelli. This fried vermicelli will then be soaked in a sugar syrup.Soak 1 cup of the Govind Bhog rice in water for 1 to 2 hours. After a couple of hours, drain the water and spread the rice over a kitchen towel and allow it to dry.Once dry place the rice in a dry grinder and grind to a fine powder. Add the rice powder and chena to a large mixing bowl. Knead both of them together adding little milk at a time to make a soft, firm and smooth dough. Cover and allow the dough to rest for a few minutes till we get the sugar syrup ready. For the sugar syrup, place the sugar along with 1 cup of water and bring it to a boil. Once the sugar comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer to make a sticky syrup. When you touch the syrup between your fingers, it should feel sticky and slightly stringy. Once the sugar syrup is ready, add the cardamom powder and the saffron to it and allow it to rest. We will now deep fry the rice mixture by making it either into oblong shape by running it through a grater or a sev maker. The size of the rice vermicelli is purely your preference.Heat oil for deep frying. Once the oil is heated, place the rice and chena mixture through a grater and grate it into the hot oil. You will notice small rice size bits drop out into the oil.  Deep fry on medium heat till the Bhog turns golden brown in color. Drain out the excess oil and proceed the same way with the remaining rice mixture. Add the raisins and the fried rice and chena into the sugar syrup. Allow it to soak well in the syrup for about 10 to 15 minutes. You will notice the rice and chena vermicelli starts to puff up and turn soft.Once it is soaked, spread it on a plate and allow the grains of sugar coated rice to cool. In the next step we will make the Nikhuti (the jamoon balls).In a large mixing bowl add milk powder, maida, soda, ghee and yogurt and mix them all together. Add little water at a time and knead to make a firm and smooth dough. Allow the dough to test for about 5 to 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, shape them into small tiny jamoons (balls). In the same oil we deep fried the rice vermicelli, heat that oil and add a few jamoons at a time and deep fry until golden brown in color. Once fried, keep them aside.The next step is to soak these jamoons in a sugar syrup. To make the sugar syrup in another pan add water and sugar and bring it to boil.Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat to medium and make a light syrup. This syrup does not have to be very sticky. Once the syrup is ready, place the small jamoon balls into the hot syrup and allow it to soak and become soft. These Nikhuti's will puff up a little.Once soaked drain from the syrup and add it to the rice vermicelli we made.Transfer it to a serving bowl, garnish it with pistachios.Serve the Bengali Sita Bhog along with Mishti Doi as desserts after a meal of Bengali Luchi and Aloo Parwal Sabzi.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Orange Rasmalai Recipe, we will first begin by making the cottage cheese.Heat 2 liters of milk in a heavy bottom pan. When the milk comes to a roaring boil, add orange juice, orange zest and vinegar. The milk will curdle immediately. Turn off the heat and let the curdled milk rest for 3-4 minutes in its whey.After about 3 to 4 minutes, strain the curdled milk onto a cheesecloth or a cloth strainer. Let it drip and drain until all the whey has drained out and we have thick cottage cheese (chenna). This will take a few hours. So proceed to the next steps once the chenna is ready.Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 liter milk in a heavy bottom pan and cook on medium heat till the milk has reduced to half. Keep stirring the milk occasionally to prevent the milk from getting settled at the bottom of the pan.Once the milk has reduced to half its quantity, add the 1/2 cup sugar, a pinch of orange color and orange essence to the reduced milk and keep this aside. Pour the reduced milk into a serving bowl which is large enough to hold the cooked chenna balls.Once the chenna is ready, we will proceed to shape the chenna. Place the chenna into a bowl, add arrowroot powder and a pinch of orange color to it. Mash the chenna with the heels of your palm till smooth. The process is more like a kneading and mash technique that makes the chenna soft. Continue with the knead and mash motion until the chenna feels soft.Once the chenna is soft, shape the chenna into 12 to 15 small balls and flatten them slightly. Keep these balls aside.The next step is to cook the chenna - yes its double cooking process to get the spongy nature of the cottage cheese balls in the Ras Malai.To begin, heat water and 1-1/2 cup sugar in a pressure cooker. Stir well until all the sugar has dissolved completely. When the water comes to a rolling boil, add a few chenna balls in the pressure cooker. Cover the lid, place the weight on and cook the chenna balls for 2 whistles on high heat.Remove the pressure cookerAfter the two whistles, turn off the heat, place the pressure cooker under running water to release the pressure immediately. The process of placing the pressure cooker under cold water ensures safety when releasing the pressure.Once you open, you will notice the Chenna Balls would have puffed up and expanded. Remove the cooked chenna balls using a slotted spoon and add them to the reduced milk.Cook the remaining chenna balls in the same manner and add them to the reduced milk. The Orange Rasmalai is now ready to be refrigerated.Place the Orange Rasmalai in the refrigerator for at least 5-6 hours and then serve them as a dessert for parties. Garnish with dry fruit slivers and orange slices.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Angoori Rasmalai, we will first have to make the chena or the cottage cheese for the rasmalai. Heat 1 liter of the milk in a heavy bottomed pan. Allow the milk to come to a brisk boil. Once the milk comes to a brisk boil, pour in the lime juice and give the milk a stir. Turn off the heat. You will notice that the milk curdles immediately after the addition of the lemon juice and clear whey will separate.Strain the chena in a muslin cloth strainer and allow the excess liquid to drain out. Let it rest in the strainer for about an hour.  After a couple of hours you will notice the chena is separated from all its whey.Place the chena in a wide mixing bowl and begin to knead the chena with the heel of your palm. Knead well for about 5 to 10 minutes until you get a really smooth dough. Make small bite size balls of the chena dough. Roll the chena balls between your palm to make the outer surface smooth. This will be your angoori (grape sized) rasmalai balls. Boil the 3 cups of water and the sugar in a wide pressure cooker. Add 2 powdered green cardamoms in it. Once the syrup comes to a rolling boil place the chena balls in very carefully.Attach the lid and cook on medium until two whistles. Let the steam and pressure dissipate naturally.Open and carefully take the angoori rasmalai balls out one by one. Try not to crowd the cooker or the tiny balls will break. Cook these chena balls in 2-3 batches.Take out the balls from the syrup and gently squeeze out the syrup and keep aside.While the chena balls are simmering, start boiling the remaining half litre milk in another heavy bottomed pan. Once it comes to boil add the condensed milk and let it simmer on medium heat for 15-20 minutes.Stir occasionally to prevent it from burning at the bottom. Add the chena balls in it along with crushed cardamom powder and simmer gently for another couple of minutes.Cool and serve the Angoori Rasmalai with a generous sprinkle of flaked almonds and chopped pistachios.Serve Angoori Rasmalai along with Bengali Sita Bhog as desserts during the festive season pr when you have guests coming over.Note: To make the angoori rasmalais in a pan make the same syrup in a heavy bottomed wide pan.

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Dark Chocolate Sandesh (Shondesh) Dipped In Chocolate Recipe, first prepare the chenna or fresh cottage cheese, which is the base for many Bengali sweets.To do this, place the full fat milk in a saucepan or heavy bottomed pan and bring it to a boil. Once the milk is bubbling away, add the lemon juice and turn off the heat. The milk will curdle and coagulate within seconds.Once the entire milk has coagulated and you see the cheese floating on top and a clear whey separated from it. Prepare the chenna and rinse it under running water thoroughly. Tie it in a cheese cloth and hang it to drain out the excess water. This process takes at least for a couple of hours.In the meantime, chop the dark chocolate into small chunks to make it easier to melt. Place a sauce pan with water over a medium heat. In a heatproof bowl which is slightly larger than the saucepan, add the chopped chocolate and place this bowl over the saucepan, ensuring that the boiling water doesn’t touch the surface of the heatproof bowl.The heat generated by the boiling water will melt the chocolate gently. Lower the heat and begin to melt the chocolate with a spatula, till it is smooth and glossy.Add the cocoa powder and vanilla essence to the melted chocolate and keep it aside.Time to check on the chenna once again. Once most of the water is drained out, tip the cheese on a flat surface and begin kneading it, pressing it down and forward with the heel of your palm.Working it on the surface like you would dough for chapatis or puris. The kneading is most important as it makes the chenna smooth, and almost like a fine paste by the end of the process.Note: If kneading the sondesh takes too much time and effort, you could also use a food processor. However the result will be a finer paste-like sondesh, while this recipe tastes good when the chenna mix is well-kneaded, but slightly grainy.Reserving about 3 tablespoons of the melted chocolate in a smaller bowl, add the rest of the melted chocolate to the kneaded chenna. Add the condensed milk and once again mix until it is well combined.Heat a heavy bottomed pan and tip the chenna mixture into it. Cook on medium heat until the mixture begins to leave the sides of the pan and come together as a ball.Remove the mixture from the heat, add the raisins and mix well. Once it is cool enough to work with, divide the chenna into 12 equal parts. Shape them into round balls and lightly flatten each by patting them softly with your fingers.Dip half the balls in melted chocolate reserved separately earlier and top it off with roasted slivered almonds. Place the balls chocolate side up, to set a little.Serve the Dark Chocolate Sandesh on Angoori Rasmalai.",

        "RecipeName": "Whole Wheat Pita Bread",
        "Ingredients": "1-1/2 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida),1-1/2 cups Whole Wheat Flour,2 teaspoons Active dry yeast,1/2 teaspoons Salt,1-1/2 teaspoons Sugar,1-1/4 cups Lukewarm Water,2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil",

        "Diet": "Vegetarian",
        "Instructions": "To begin making the Pita bread we will first have to get your ingredients ready especially the yeast. If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet.If you are using fast action yeast (looks more like fine semolina) then in a large bowl combine the flours, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky. Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes. Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours.After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled. At this point punch the dough down and knead gently. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C. The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them. Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread. Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well. Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle. Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick. Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven. Bake the pita dough until they puff - you will see them rising forming bubbles, to slowly puffing and fully puffing up.The whole process takes a maximum or 3-5 minutes and not more than 5 minutes. If the pita bread does not rise in 5 minutes, then take them out. The Pita Bread will still be cooked, but just wont have pockets and will still taste just as good.You can serve Whole Wheat Pita Bread Recipe along with soups or make it into sandwiches like Egg Bhurji Stuffed Pita Pockets Recipe, Aloo Tikki Stuffed Pita Sandwich Recipe, Pita Sandwich With Cauliflower Falafel And Roasted Vegetables Recipe and more.",

[please note: do not use your electric beater for this process]Grease and line a cake tin.Now divide the prepared cake batter into 2 equal parts and add into 2 bowls.Mix the instant coffee powder in 2.5 tablespoons water to form a thick creamy coffee paste.Add the coffee paste into one portion of cake batter and gently fold it in till well incorporated. [do a taste test once fully mixed and add more coffee-warm water paste if you like a stronger flavor]Add the rest of the warm water to the plain cake batter and mix well.Now you have both your cake mixes ready.Into the prepared cake tin, first add a dollop of plain cake batter. Follow it up by a dollop of coffee flavored cake batter. Continue this process till you have used up your entire cake batter.Tap the bottom of your cake tin on your work surface, to ensure there are no air bubbles.Take a skewer/ toothpick and swirl it around the mixture in the tin a few times to create a marbled effect.Bake the cake at 180 degree Celsius for 40 to 45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. [oven times may vary, so be careful not to burn your cake]Turn out onto a cooling rack and leave to cool.Slice and serve Barley Whole wheat Coffee Marble Cake Recipe with a glass of milk or just as it is.

You will get 28 pieces approximately.Now take a piece and flatten it out a little in a circular shape and put some chocolate chip filling in the center, wrap the dough around the filling and pinch the dough in the center. Shape into balls. Do the same with the rest of the remaining dough.Line a baking tray with baking paper and place the honeycomb dough balls in the shape of a Christmas tree. If you like you can just place them in a round greased cake pan as well.Cover the bread with a towel or another tray and keep them to rise again for an hour until the balls of dough have risen.Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius for ten minutes.Now glaze the honeycomb bread generously with softened or melted butter and bake for 15 minutes.Make the honey glaze white the bread is in the oven.

I found it easiest working with a tablespoon and scooped out about 2-3 tablespoons of dough per portion; you could also use a 1/4 cup measure or eyeball it, whatever works for you.Once you have portioned the dough, roll it into balls then flatten the dough ball (I used my hands) and place a frozen nutella ball in the centre of each dough ball.Stretch the cookie dough from the sides so that the nutella ball in the centre is completely covered with the cookie dough. The nutella starts to melt pretty quickly so remove from the freezer in batches or just put it back into the freezer to harden.Place the cookies on a baking sheet about 2 inches apart, sprinkle with the left over chocolate chips and freeze for an hour.Preheat the Oven to 175 degrees Celsius.Bake cookies straight out of the freezer, for 12-15 minutes, on a baking sheet. Cookies are done when they’re slightly crispy around the edges and still soft in the center.Let the Chocolate Nutella Lava Cookies Recipe rest for about ten minutes before serving.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Healthy Whole Wheat Brown Butter Banana Bread Recipe, melt the butter in a pan on medium heat. Butter will start foaming and crackling. Swirl the pan as the crackling subsides.At this stage the butter will start to change its colour to brown and will begin to start smelling nutty. Turn off the flame and transfer butter to a large mixing bowl. Allow the butter it cool.Pre-heat oven to 175 degree Celsius. Grease an 8X5 inch loaf tin with butter and line with parchment paper in such a way that the parchment paper hangs over the edges. This will help you lift out the banana bread easily once it's baked.Place some almonds on a baking sheet and put it into the oven while it is preheating, so the nuts get roasted in the preheating process. Keep it for about 7 to 8 minutes. Once the nuts are roasted, chop them up and keep aside.Once the butter has cooled, add sugar and mix well. Add the eggs (or flax meal egg replacer) one at a time, mixing after each egg till everything has combined. Add the milk and vanilla extract to this mixture, and give it another whisk.Peel the bananas and mash them into the mixture.In another bowl, combine the flours, baking soda and salt. Sift this into the bowl with the banana mixture, and fold until everything is combined. There is no need to blend or over mix at this stage. Add the nuts and fold again.Pour the banana bread cake batter into the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle with a little sugar on the top, this gives an amazing crunchy crust to the bread.Tap once to get rid of air bubbles, and place the banana bread loaf pan in the oven. Bake for about 50 to 60 minutes. Start checking for done-ness around 50 minutes. A skewer or fork inserted into the middle should come out clean when it done. Once baked, let the bread cool in the pan for 8-10 minutes. Lift the bread using parchment paper and let it cool on a wire rack for another 10 minutes before serving.Serve the Healthy Whole Wheat Brown Butter Banana Bread  as a tea time snack or pack into the lunch boxes for the kids school.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Pearl Barley Vegetable Soup, make sure you have soaked the barley for at least 5 to 6 hours. The soaking process helps to cook the grains faster and more evenly.Our next step is to get all the ingredients ready. If you don't have vegetable stock ready, you can use water, but you will have to adjust the taste and spices accordingly once the soup is ready.We will use a pressure cooker method to cook the Pearl Barley Vegetable Soup. If you plan to use the saucepan method, continue with the similar procedure, but cook until the barley has cooked through completely and is edible.Heat oil in the pressure cooker on medium heat; add the onions, garlic and celery. Saute for a couple of minutes until they become lightly tender. Add the remaining ingredients, except the parsley and give it a good stir. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and cook until you hear 3 to 4 whistles. After 3 to 4 whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer the soup for another 5 to 10 minutes. After which, turn off the heat.Allow the pressure cooker to rest until the pressure releases naturally. The cooking process continues in the cooker as long as there is pressure inside it.Once the pressure is released, you can open the cooker and the soup will be ready. Do check if the barley is cooked through, sometimes the age of the grain makes it take a little longer than expected. Check the salt and spice levels, adjust to suit your taste and stir in the parsley.Serve the Pearl Barley Vegetable Soup as a wholesome meal for weeknight dinner along with warm Masala French Toast.",

        "Diet": "Diabetic Friendly",
        "Instructions": "To begin making the Quick Puff Pastry Recipe Sheet for making puffs, measure all the ingredients and keep them ready.Add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl and give a quick stir to combine it. Add the large cubes of butter into the flour mixture.Ensure each piece of butter is coated fully into flour. When it is coated in flour it will be less likely to melt and also less likely to melt out of the dough later when we roll to make the sheets.This process of covering the butter with flour is called lamination of the butter with flour. If it is not laminated well, the butter will melt out of the dough and you will end up with a puff that is not flaky. Next, squish up the cubes of butter coated with flour by pressing between your fingers.  Like shown in the image below.Once all the pieces are squished, just toss them in flour once again. You need to ensure all the butter pieces are well coated with flour.Make a well in the center and add little ice water at a time. Starting with 1/3 cup and then adding more if required a tablespoon at a time. Because every single brand of flour absorbs moisture differently, we need to ensure we add that water little at a time. To mix the water in, toss the flour into the water and it helps the water get incorporated to form the dough without kneading. Do not knead the dough, as it can activate too much gluten.When it gets to a stage where the puff pastry dough forms large clumps, you can knead a little to understand how much more moisture is needed to bring the dough together without breaking those butter shingles. Add a few tablespoons of water if needed again to bring the dry flour together to form the dough. It is important to get the dough to the right hydration level. If it becomes too wet, then the dough will become sticky and might not be the best thing for puff pastry. Gently press and bring the flour together to form a dough without kneading. It is important to work as quickly as possible. If you take too long and knead too long the heat from your hands will melt the butter and make it sticky. We need to ensure that the butter is still in big pieces in the dough after bringing it together.The dough will look rough and not smooth and you will be able to see the big chunks of butter and will not look totally smooth.Divide the dough in two halves and shape each piece into an almost square disk.Wrap each disc of dough in a plastic/ cling film wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. Based on the warmth and the humidity of the region, a minimum one hour will allow the dough to rest before we begin the folds to make the puff pastry sheet.After one hour, remove the dough from the refrigerator.Dust the working surface with very little flour. Open one of the discs while the other is still in refrigeration. First RoundRoll out the dough into a rough rectangle shape to about 1/2 inch thickness. The dough will be tough, so use a little muscle to roll it out.If you feel the dough is sticky with butter, sprinkle a little bit of flour in the area where the butter feels sticky.  Ensure you dust off any excess flour.Once you have rolled it into a 1/2 inch thick rectangle, fold the dough into half and then fold the half into a quarter again. This is the first fold. We will proceed to make the 2nd fold in the same round.Dust a little flour if required and roll into a 1/2 inch rectangle again and then do the folds (first into half and then again fold the half into a quarter).Wrap this dough the same cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour until the dough is firm.Second RoundAfter an hour, repeat the process mentioned in the first round again. Once you are done with at least 3 to 4 rounds of rolling, folding and chilling process, the puff pastry dough is ready. You need to ensure you refrigerate the puff pastry dough for at least 6 to 8 hours before you are ready to use it to make puffs, tarts and more. These puff pastry sheets can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 to 4 months. When you are ready to use them, thaw for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature and begin using it for the recipes.",

        "Instructions": "To make Chocolate Mocha Cake:To begin making Ice Cream Cake Recipe With Chocolate Mocha Frosting, start with making the chocolate mocha cake first.Also keep the ice cream and all the other ingredients ready for later use.Preheat oven to 350 degrees Centigrade or 180 degrees Fahrenheit.Grease and flour an 8-inch spring form pan. I have lined the bottom with foil and then greased and floured it to make removing the cake easier. Keep aside.In a small bowl, mix the dry ingredients of the cake- whole wheat flour, brown sugar, cocoa powder, instant coffee powder and salt. Mix well with a wire whisk.To this mixture, add oil, vanilla essence, 1 tablespoon vinegar and 1 cup water.Mix well with a spoon or fork until thoroughly blended.Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 30 to 35 minutes until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.Remove the cake pan from oven and cool the cake without removing it from the pan, on a wire rack for about 10 minutes.After 10 minutes, remove from springform pan and foil; cool the chocolate mocha cake completely on cooling wire rack.After the cake has completely cooled, using a large sharp knife, cut the cake into half horizontally - to form two thin layers of cake. Return one layer to the spring form pan and close the latch. Place the pan in a deep freezer for about 1 to 2 hours to chill the cake.Meanwhile, remove one flavor of ice cream (I have used black currant ice cream) and let it soften at room temperature. Ice cream should be soft enough to be spread easily on the chilled cake, and also should not be melting. You can alternatively take out the chilled ice cream and beat in a hand mixer to smoothen it up.Once the ice cream is soft enough to spread, remove the pan with the first layer of cake from freezer. Spread softened ice cream on top of that layer and smoothen with an offset spatula. I have used about 1 liter of ice cream for the first layer of ice cream. Place the second layer of cake over this and return the pan to freezer to let the ice cream to set completely; about 2 to 3 hours.Remove the second flavor of ice cream from freezer and let soften at room temperature until soft and spreadable.Remove the cake pan from freezer and spread second layer of ice cream evenly and smoothen the top to level as much as possible. Return the springform pan to the freezer for about 3 to 4 hours to freeze it completely. It is best to keep it overnight in the freezer.The next day, prepare chocolate ganache and chocolate mocha icing.Once you prepare the chocolate ganache, as the ganache is cool but still in liquid form, remove ice cream cake from freezer and release the latch of the springform pan and remove the vertical side of the pan, leaving the ice cream cake on the base of the pan.Gently pour ganache over the cake to cover the top fully and let the glaze drip over the sides of the cake. This process should be done quickly, taking care not to allow the ice cream to melt.For Chocolate Mocha Icing:In a small bowl, sift icing sugar, coffee powder and salt; mix well. Keep aside.In a large mixing bowl, beat ½ cup of softened butter until soft and creamy, with the help of a hand mixer. Stir in vanilla essence and beat again.To this, add icing sugar mixture in batches on low speed until it is well combined with the butter-vanilla mixture; scraping down the sides as required.Add milk a teaspoon at a time until you get the consistency you want. I used about 2 teaspoons of milk to get a frosting soft enough to flow through the cake decorating nozzle, but stiff enough to form chocolate kisses on top of cake using the star tip.Once the cake is fully frozen again, remove from freezer and using a decorating tip, pipe borders on top and bottom of cake. Decorate with cherries and return to freezer to freeze again until serving time.Although the whole process is time consuming, the end result is worth it! Remove cake from freezer about 10 minutes before serving time.Serve Ice Cream Cake Recipe With Chocolate Mocha Frosting with Crunchy Baked Cheese Crisps Recipe, Cottage Cheese Dip Recipe With Pepper and Olives, Grilled Spicy Potato Sandwich Recipe and Ice-Apple And Plum Rose Juice Recipe to celebrate a birthday bash or an evening party.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making this Vegan Guilt Free Chocolate Espresso Mousse Recipe, first melt the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl.Place all the dark chocolate in the bowl and microwave it at 20 seconds intervals until it has just melted.Take care not to overheat the chocolate. Once melted, remove it from the microwave and give it a quick mix. Set it aside in the bowl to cool down a bit.While the chocolate is melting, make a coffee decoction as below or prepare the espresso in a coffee machine using fresh coffee beans.To make the decoction add 1/4 cup warm water to 4 tablespoons of instant coffee powder and stir well to make a coffee decoction.When ready, and the chocolate has cooled, add coffee decoction to melted chocolate and mix it well.Next add the ripe bananas, ripe avocados, melted chocolate with coffee, cocoa powder and sugar into a blender and blitz into a smooth paste. Do not add any water at this stage as we want the mixture to be thick. This will help it set like mousse.Transfer the fruit and chocolate espresso mixture for the mousse into 6 individual serving cups or a large serving bowl and chill it in the refrigerator, until it is set (about 8 hours). Pouring it into individual bowls will help set it faster, whereas a big serving bowl may take a while longer.While the dessert is getting set we will proceed to make the Vegan Coconut Milk Whipped Cream. To make the Coconut Whipped Cream, it is important for the coconut milk to be refrigerated for 6 to 8 hours. This refrigeration process helps thicken the coconut milk. Remove the excess liquids after refrigeration and use only the solids. Using a cloth mesh strainer will help separate the whey.Place the refrigerated coconut milk in a chilled mixing bowl, add the icing sugar and vanilla essence. Using an electric beater, whisk until it forms stiff peaks. Refrigerate this coconut cream until you are ready to use it.When you are ready to serve, garnish the Vegan Chocolate Espresso Mousse with whipped coconut milk cream and some chocolate shavings.Enjoy the guilt free Vegan Chocolate Espresso Mousse at the end of a Weekend Dinner or Dinner Party.Serve Vegan Guilt Free Chocolate Espresso Mousse Recipe as dessert after a meal of  Loaded Veggie Nachos Recipe - A Delicious Mexican Appetizer and Red Bean Mexican Burrito Bowl Recipe - Roz Ka Khana With Figaro Olive Oil.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Eggless or Vegan Christmas Cake Recipe, we first have to soak all the dry fruits in rum and juice (you can avoid the rum). This process helps ferment the fruits and also helps to release all the flavors and make the christmas cake moist and rich.Place the sultanas, dried prunes, dried dates, dried figs and dried apricots into a large mixing bowl. Pour over the rum and orange juice and sprinkle over the orange zest. Mix until well combined, then cover the bowl with cling film and set aside overnight or a few weeks or a month or a year. They say the longer you ferment, the fruits get fermented, the richer the taste of the christmas cake.To Make Flax Meal Egg Replacer If your recipe asks for 4 eggs, measure 12 tablespoons of flax meal along with 6 tablespoons of water. Stir well and let the mixture rest for about 15 minutes. This process of resting helps the flax meal mixture develop a gelatinous consistency similar to eggs.To make the Batter Proceed to the remaining steps are once the fermentation of the fruits are over.Preheat the oven to 170 C.Sift the flour, baking powder and the spices together and keep aside. I like to sift it twice over as the flour gets good air pockets and also makes the cake more fluffy.Line the base and sides of a 9 inch spring foam cake pan with a double layer parchment paper, making sure the paper reaches the top of the tin.In a large bowl or a KitchenAid Stand Mixer, whisk the butter (oil) and sugar together until fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs (flaxmeal egg replacer), one at a time. Add in the flour slowly until well combined.Slowly add in the soaked dried fruits, its liquids, the almond powder, chopped nuts and combine it into the flour mixture. Dont over beat, we just want all the ingredients to be well combined.Spoon the above cake mixture into the spring foam pan and level the surface with the back of a spoon. Bake for 1 and a half hours approximately or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.The cake typically tends to darken a lot during baking, if this happens cover the top with parchment paper in the middle of the baking process.Once the christmas cake is baked remove it from the oven allow it to cool completely in the pan.Store the Christmas Cake (eggless/ vegan) in an airtight container, wrapped in greaseproof paper and aluminium foil, for two to three months.You can also bake the Traditional Christmas Cake in smaller pans and gift them to your family this holiday season.Serve the Traditional Christmas Cake along with Qahwa | Arabic Coffee Recipe and Ginger Cardamom Chai (Spice Infused Indian Style Milk Tea) to compliment the cake for your evening.",

Stir and whisk continuously till you get a smooth and slightly thickened frosting.While the cake is still warm, spread the buttercream frosting over the top of the cake.Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours for the frosting to set.Serve this delicious and moist Eggless Whole Wheat Cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting Recipe during tea time or after Delicious Italian Chicken Cacciatore Recipe with Mushrooms & Olives dinner meal served as dessert.",

Once the oil is hot add the garlic, ginger, onions, green chillies and saute for a minute. Next add the capsicum and saute till the onions and capsicum turn soft.Once done add the cabbage, carrot and sprinkle some salt. Do not add too much salt as the sauces have salt added to them.

Do not cut it while it is warm or hot as it will crumble.The next step is to prepare the tadka along with the sugar lemon water.Preheat a pan with oil over medium heat; add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds and allow it to crackle. Once it crackles, add the green chillies and curry leaves and stir for about a minute. Once done, add the water, lemon juice, sugar and salt. Stir well until the sugar has dissolved and turn off the heat. Allow the tadka to cool a bit. Once the Khaman Dhokla has cooled completely, cut it into squares or diamonds. Spoon the tadka over the Khaman Dhokla so it gets soaked well. If there is more tadka water remaining, just keep it aside and pour it later when you feel it has become dry or you want it more juicy.Remove the Khaman Dhokla from the pan and place it on a serving platter. Sprinkle freshly grated coconut and chopped coriander leaves and serve. Serve it along with Green Chutney and Adrak Chai as an evening snack.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Tawa Handvo recipe we first need to wash and soak the rice and lentils together in 3 cups of water for 4 to 5 hours.Grind the rice, lentils, green chillies, ginger and salt along with the soaked water and yogurt to make a thick batter that is slightly coarse. The coarseness should feel like fine semolina.The consistency of the batter should be such that when you use a ladle to pour it should fall in dollops. Stir in the salt and allow the mixture to ferment for 8 hours.Once fermented you will notice the dough has risen.  Gently stir in a tablespoon of oil to the batter. If your batter for some reason did not rise; stir 2 teaspoons of enos fruit salt into the batter and you will notice the air bubbles start popping out from the batter. Finally stir in the grated bottle gourd and turmeric. (This is the time you would stir in the other vegetables you would use)Heat one tablespoon of oil in a nonstick skillet (8 inches diameter) on medium high heat; add the mustard seeds, sesame seeds and curry leaves; allow them to crackle. Turn the heat to low and sprinkle the red chilli powder and asafoedita into the oil.Pour two ladles of batter into the pan and gently spread the batter evenly onto the pan. As you spread the batter the seasoning mixture will spread to the side; allow the seasoning to rest in places where it has spread as this gives a special crunchiness to the sides of the Handvo.Turn the heat low, drizzle a teaspoon of oil around the batter and cover the pan. Simmer for 3-4 minutes until the top feels cooked and steamed.Once you notice the top is cooked and there is no trace of raw batter, gently flip the Handvo with the help of a broad flat spatula to the opposite side and turn the heat to medium high.Allow it to turn golden brown and crisp. Flip over once again and allow the other side to brown and crisp slightly. Continue making similar cakes with the rest of the batter and serve hot.Serve Tawa Handvo lentil skillet pancakes along with Gor Keri pickle or with Gor (jaggery) and homemade butter for breakfast or a weeknight dinner.",

Cover and let the dough sit in a cool place until we get the puran filling ready. Divide the dough into 6 portions.Soak the dal for 15 to 20 minutes in water.Add the soaked dal with 1-1/4 cups of water (includes the soaked water) into the pressure cooker and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whisltes and turn off the heat. Allow the pressure to release naturally. Once the pressure releases, give the dal a quick mash.The next step is the make the puran filling. Into a heavy bottomed pan, add the cooked dal, and jaggery.Keep stirring until the jaggery dissolves completely.Stir in the saffron, cardamom and nutmeg to the jaggery mixture until well combined to make the puran poli filling. Add the besan at this point and mix it into the dal mixture and ensure it blends well without any lumps.Continue stirring the puran poli mixture until the dal mixture begins to thicken and leaves the sides of the pan.At this point turn off the heat and allow the puran poli mixture to cool completely. Divide the dough and puran mixture into 6 portions.Keeping a little flour for dusting handy on a plate; roll out the puran poli dough into 3 inch diameter circles.Place a portion of the puran poli mixture into the center of the circle.Bring edges of the circle towards the center and fold over to cover the entire filling; making sure the edges are all sealed well by pinching them together if there is any opening.Flatten the stuffed dough; dust over a little flour and roll gently into a 4 to 6 inch diameter circle taking care not to put too much pressure as the puran can come out of the dough.Preheat a skillet on medium high; place the rolled puran poli onto the skillet to cook until golden brown on both sides. At this point you can cook it along with ghee to make the puran poli crisp and delicious. Or you can make a dry puran poli and serve it along with ghee.Repeat the above process for all the remaining dough and puran portions.Serve the Gujarati Puran Poli hot with ghee smeared on the top as it is or along with Undhiyu and Gujarati Kadhi to make a delicious meal.",

Once the sugar has dissolved and the milk is boiling vigorously for a few minutes reduce the heat to low and simmer the milk mixture stirring continuously until it is reduced to three fourths of its original quantity. The condensation will cause the cream from the milk to settle on the sides and bottom of the pan. Its important to keep scraping down the cream and adding it back to the condensing milk.The mixture will begin to thicken and get a creamy texture. It is important to make sure towards the end of the condensing process to be close to the stove monitoring the milk and stirring it continuously. The last stages are when the condensed milk can get burned at the bottom of the pan and completely alter the taste of the basundi.Note Again: During the process of condensation of the milk, keep stirring the cream that keep forms, as it will stick to the sides and bottom of of them pan, while stirring keep scrapping down the sides and bottom to prevent burning of the cream.Once the milk has reduced to half of its original quantity, turn off the heat. The Basundi (Rabri) is almost ready. All you have to do now is to  stir in the cardamom powder and the finely chopped nuts.Transfer the Basundi (Rabri) to a serving dish and allow it to cool before you can refrigerate for 3-4 hours. Serve the Basundi (Rabri) hot or cold, during any season or serve it as a party dessert and enjoy.Note: You can add fruits like Lychee's and Strawberries to make a delicious Strawberry Rabri or Lychee Rabri.

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Corn Matar Kachori Recipe, we will first make the dough for the outer crust of the Matar Kachori.In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients for the Kachori dough to form a crumble like texture. Gradually add water into the flour mixture and knead to make a soft and smooth dough.Once all the flour has come together, keep kneading for 3 to 4 minutes so the dough becomes smooth and soft. Cover the dough and keep it aside for 10 minutes till we prepare the filling for the kachori.The next step is to make the filling for the Corn and Matar Kachori.Into a food processor, add all the filling ingredients and pulse to make a coarse mixture. Once the kachori filling is ready, transfer to a bowl, check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.The next step is the roll out the dough and make the Matar Kachoris. You can either shape them as flat breads or keep it as a ball, its a personal choice.And to cook the Kachori's you can either use an Air Fryer, Bake in an Oven or Deep Fry them. I have tried all the methods and my favorite has been with the Air Fryer. The best part about using the Air Fryer is, I was able to pre-make these Kachoris in the Air Fryer and reheat it in the Air Fryer to make it crisp again.Divide the dough into 12 to 15 equal portions and roll out each dough into 2 inch diameter circles.Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of the rolled out dough. Bring all the sides of the dough together to seal the filling. Twist the dough to seal the Corn Matar Kachori well. When you bring the dough you might find some excess dough collected on the top, remove this dough.Proceed to make the remaining Matar Kachoris the similar way.You can either choose to keep the Kachori like a ball or roll the Kachori gently to make a 3 inch diameter circle. Take care when you roll, as the filling might spill out.If you are using the Air Fryer or the Oven, then preheat them at 180 C for about 15 minutes. Place the Kachoris in the Air Fryer Basket or the Baking sheet (for the oven) and bake until the Kachoris are golden brown and crisp on all sides.If you plan to deep fry them, then preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is heated, fry the Kachoris on low to medium heat until you get a deep golden brown color and it is crisp. Once golden, drain on absorbent paper and proceed to make the remaining Kachoris the similar way.Serve these mouth watering Corn and Matar Kachoris as a tea time or evening snack along with Green Chutney and Date Chutney. You can also serve them as starter for dinner parties.",

Mix it all together very well till it forms a mixture that is wet, but not so soggy that it cannot be easily handled.Set the mixture aside for 10-15 minutes to rest. Then divide it into 12-14 equal parts and shape them into small patties. To shape the patties with ease, it may help to grease your palms with a little oil so that the batter doesn't stick.The patties shouldn’t be too thick, as that will make it take longer to cook and absorb too much oil. Ensure that they are thin enough to cook easily and also hold shape.Preheat a skillet on medium heat. Place the patties on the skillet, drizzle some oil on the top and cook them evenly until golden brown and crisp on both sides.Keep turning them around until they are golden on both sides. Once done, remove the patties and place them on kitchen paper to drain the excess oil.Serve the Sesame Bread Patties (Bread Cutlets) along with lime wedges, tomato ketchup or Salad and serve it for a weeknight dinner.",

Once spinach is completely dry, turn off heat and keep it aside to cool down.Add roasted cumin powder, chaat masala to grated paneer. Add cooked spinach mix and mix them all together. This paratha stuffing mixture should be dry. If you find any liquid in it, squeeze it out. Divide them into equal sized balls.In a small bowl, combine the corn flour along with water to make a thick paste. This will be used for sealing the edges.Knead the paratha dough once more and divide them into equal sized balls (lemon sized). Roll it thin about 10 inch. Place it on hot griddle/tawa and cook for 10 seconds on each sides, without oil. Dont over cook it. Take it out of tawa. Repeat this for rest of the dough.Now place half cooked rotis on a flat surface. Place a small portion of spinach paneer stuffing in the center. Spread the stuffing all over leaving out the edges.Apply corn flour paste on the edges of the roti. Fold the 2 opposite corners of the roti over the stuffing. Now fold the remaining 2 edges sealing the filling well.

Divide the dough into 10 equal portions.  Preheat a skillet on medium heat. If you are using a cast iron skillet, then grease the skillet well and allow it to preheat.Keep some flour aside for dusting while rolling the dough. Shape each dough portion into a round ball, press it between the palm of your hands.Dust the dough in flour and roll it into a 6 inch diameter circle. Smear some ghee or oil on this rolled out dough. Dust some flour over the ghee. This flour and ghee will help the lachha paratha split itself into layers.Fold the lachha paratha dough like an accordion, similar to a saree pleat. Start from one end of the dough and reach the end. The dough is essentially made into a pleat. Once you have stacked up all the pleats one over the other, roll the dough into a swiss roll. Flatten the pleated swiss roll between the palm of your hands, dust in flour and roll into a 4 to 5 inch diameter circle. You will be able to see the layers very clearly.Place the rolled layered Lachha Paratha on the preheated skillet.

You may need more or less flour according to the type of flour you use. It should not stick to your hands and should not crack when formed into a ball.If you want to add filling then take a small ball size of the dough and flatten them a bit with your fingers on your palm then take a small pea sized fiiling of your desire and place it in the center then bring the ends together and form a ball. (its the same process as making a kachori)In a baking sheet place small balls of cookies but do not flatten them with your hands Bake it at 200 degree celcius for about 30 minutes, keep a close eye to the cookies while its baking as we do not need to brown the cookies from top, which makes them melt in your mouth.Take out the cookies once baked and nicely browned from bottom and let them cool down a little in the sheet itself. Do not try to touch them at this point as they are likey to break.Once the cookies are cooled down but slightly warm sprinkle powdered sugar on top of them with the help of a sieve. Do not dip them directly in the sugar as they are very soft and likely to break.The sugar will slightly melt after sometime then do a second round of sprinkling sugar, be generous in coating them with sugar as we do not have any sugar in the cookies itself. Store them in an air tight container or serve it immediately.Serve Snow Drop Cookies along with Espresso Coffee for your tea time break. You can also pack these cookies for your kids snacks box.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Homemade Idli Dosa Batter, soak the rice in water, such that the all the rice is completely immersed in water. Let it soak for about 6 hours.Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water. Let it soak for about 6 hours.First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy. Pour this batter into a large container.Grind the rice into a smooth paste, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the dosa batter too watery. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .The rice batter is a little coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.Note on fermenting the Idli Dosa BatterFermenting has to take place where the weather is warm. So ideally summer’s the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity.But in cold places, the batter has to be kept in an oven. If your oven has light, then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven.Once the oven is warm, turn off the light and let the batter ferment.If your oven does not have a light, then preheat the oven to warm, turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment.This process can be mastered with experience.Method For making idlis from the Idli Dosa BatterThe freshly fermented batter is great for making idli's. So typically and traditionally, the first day after the rise, we made idli's at home and there after it is great for making dosa's as well.For making idlis do not dilute the batter with water.When making dosa's you can optionally dilute the batter with a little water to help in easy spreading.",

Keep this thandai masala aside.To begin making the Kulfi Recipe, the first step is to have to condense the milk. For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring it to boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously. This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it the milk is reduced to more than half of its quantity, stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Finally stir in the Thandai Paste Mix and give the mixture a good stir. You can even use a hand blender to give it a good whisk.Turn off the heat and allow the kulfi mixture to cool completely. Pour the thandai kulfi milk in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator. The Thandai Kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.Once the Thandai Kulfi is frozen you can run the kulfi moulds under water to enable easy release on to the plate.Serve Thandai Kulfi Recipe as a Indian dessert for parties or even make it as a special dessert for the festival of holi.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Orange Kulfi Recipe, we will first prepare the shell of the orange.Using the knife , cut the orange into half and scoop out the pulp of the orange or peel the pulp out of the orange skin/ shell. Enure the shell does not break. Keep the shell aside.Peel the think skin of the pulp, remove any seeds and cut the pulp into tiny pieces and keep this aside.The next step is to condense the milk to make the Kulfi. For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it is reduced to about more than half of its quantity stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Once it does, allow the kulfi milk mixture to cool completely.Once the Kulfi cools, stir in the orange marmalade and the orange pulp mixture into the condensed kulfi mixture. Pour the Orange kulfi mixture in the orange shells you kept aside or you can also set in another bowl and later serve the orange kulfi in the orange shells. I prefer the later method, as it is easier to scoop the orange kulfi like an ice cream and put it in the shells and serve it to your friends and family.Note: Freeze the orange for at least fifteen hours or more to set well. Serve the Orange Kulfi Recipe as an cold indian dessert for parties or during the festival of Holi or simply make for the summers and enjoy it with your family.",

Drizzle a teaspoon of ghee around the edges of the Malpua and allow it to cook.When you notice that that the raw batter on the top is getting cooked, flip the Malpua over to cook on the other side. Once done remove from the pan and proceed to make the remaining Mapuas.When cooked, dip the cooked Ragi Malpuas in the sugar syrup of a couple of seconds and take it out.Place the sugar-coated Ragi Malpuas on a dessert platter, spoon some Rabri on the top, sprinkle some chopped nuts.Serve the Ragi Malpuas Along With Rabri (Basundi) as a dessert when you have a party or even for festivals and special occasions along with Gulab Jamun and jalebis.",

Once the sugar has melted continue to boil the sugar mixture until the liquid reaches a two string consistency.To know the right consistency - do the cold water candy test. Take few tablespoons of water in a cup; add a drop of sugar syrup to water. If it holds its shape like a softball and doesn’t dissolve into water then it’s at the right consistency.Once the sugar syrup has reached the right consistency, add the ground pista and coconut mixture, the cardamom powder to the sugar syrup.With the heat on medium continue stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pan.In 10 to 15 minutes, the pista burfi mixture will thicken and will come away from the sides of the pan. This happens with the coconut and pista releasing its oil.At this stage turn off the heat and be careful not to stir any longer on heat as the mixture can get over cooked and will not set to the consistency required. The sugar will crystallize making the burfi very hard.Transfer the mixture on a greased square pan and spread it evenly on the top and press it down so its sets well.

Place it on a medium heat and bring it to boil. Once the sugar has dissolved completely, turn the heat down and allow the mixture to boil for a few minutes till it reaches a one-string consistency.To test if it has reached the right consistency, transfer a few drops of the syrup on a clean plate, allow it to cool for 15-20 seconds and test it for the formation of a single thread between your thumb and index finger.If the syrup has reached single thread consistency, transfer the ground cashew nut powder into the syrup and stir continuously for 4-5 minutes. The mix will gradually turn into a thick paste.Take the mixture off the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. As soon as the mix cools down slightly, grease your palms with a dash of ghee and start kneading the mix. Knead till it is smooth, uniform and like a dough.Next, spread a sheet of butter paper on the counter top. Place the dough on it and roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 5-6 mm, evenly.Place a saucepan with water on the heat. Place a heat proof bowl over it and melt the dark chocolate over it. The heat generated in the boiling water beneath will melt the chocolate gradually. Ensure that the boiling water does not touch the heatproof bowl.When the chocolate has melted properly, pour it over the rolled kaju katli dough and spread it evenly with the help of a spatula.Allow it to cool for some time and then transfer it to a surface and refrigerate it for 15-20 mins. This will help the chocolate solidify.When the chocolate has set, you can cut the Chocolate Kaju Katlis by making intersecting diagonal lines, so they form the trademark diamond shapes. Serve the Chocolate Kaju Katli Recipe along with Angoori Rasmalai Recipe at a festive gathering with family and friends.",

To do this, place the milk on high heat over a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring it boil.Add the sugar and stir continuously until the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar has dissolved and the milk is boiling vigorously for a few minutes reduce the heat to low and simmer the milk mixture stirring continuously until it is reduced to three fourths of its original quantity.The condensation will cause the cream from the milk to settle on the sides and bottom of the pan. Its important to keep scraping down the cream and adding it back to the condensing milk.The mixture will begin to thicken and get a creamy texture. It is important to make sure towards the end of the condensing process to be close to the stove monitoring the milk and stirring it continuously.The last stages are when the condensed milk can get burned at the bottom of the pan and completely alter the taste of the basundi.Note Again: During the process of condensation of the milk, keep stirring the cream that keep forms, as it will stick to the sides and bottom of of them pan, while stirring keep scrapping down the sides and bottom to prevent burning of the cream.Once the milk has reduced to half of its original quantity, turn off the heat. The Basundi (Rabri) is almost ready. All you have to do now is to  stir in the cardamom powder and the finely chopped nuts.Transfer the Basundi (Rabri) to a serving dish and allow it to cool before you can refrigerate for 3-4 hours. *For the Shahi TukdaCut each bread slice into 4 triangles. Heat a saucepan on medium flame, add ghee, and place the bread triangles. Shallow fry on both sides till you get a deep golden colour. Remove from the pan and set aside.In another pan, combine sugar, water and rose water and bring to a single boil. Turn off the flame. Dip the fried bread slices in the sugar syrup, drain and set aside.*For the Gajar ka Halwa To begin making the Gajar Halwa with Khoya, grate the washed and peeled carrots.Heat a pressure cooker on medium flame, add ghee and grated carrots and saute for a couple of minutes. Sprinkle a little water and close the pressure cooker. Pressure cook the carrots for 1 whistle and turn off the flame. Allow the pressure to release naturally.In the meanwhile, heat a kadai on medium flame, add milk and allow it to come to a rolling boil, turn down the heat and let the milk reduce to 3/4th its quantity.Once the milk has reduced and thickened, add the grated khoya, elaichi powder and sugar.Allow the khoya and sugar to melt and the whole milk mixture to come together. Now reduce the flame and transfer the cooked carrots into the milk.Continuously stir the milk and carrot mix, till you get a thick gajar halwa.Adjust sugar and elaichi according to your taste and add two more tablespoons of ghee and give the gajar halwa one final stir. Gajar Halwa is ready.To assemble the Shahi Tukda Gajar Halwa Shots With Rabri RecipeTo assemble the Gajar halwa shots dessert, fill the shot glasses with two tablespoons of gajar halwa, next top it with 1 tablespoon of rabri and place a sweet bread triangle on it.Garnish with chopped pistachios. Serve  Shahi Tukda Gajar Halwa Shots With Rabri Recipe after a delightful North Indian meal that includes Kaju Butter Masala Recipe, Palak Raita and Butter Garlic Naan Recipe (Garlic Flavoured Flat Bread) for a complete meal.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Balushahi (Badusha) recipe, we have to follow a two stage cooking process. First is to make the fried dough and second the sugar syrup. To make the dough In a large bowl add in the flour, the salt and a 1/4 teaspoon of soda. Stir to combine the dry ingredients . Next add in the ghee to the flour mixture. Using your fingers combine the flour and ghee to make coarse crumbs . Its takes a good one minute to get this texture. Once you get the coarse crumbs texture, add in the yogurt. knead just enough until all the ingredients come together.Cover the dough with a wet muslin cloth and allow it to rest for about 30 minutesAfter 30 minutes of resting the dough we will divide the dough into equal portions of large lemon size, making a dent in the center with the thumb. Take care not to press too much while shaping them as this can cause cracks in them.Cover the dough portions with a wet cloth and allow them to rest for another 15 minutes.Next, preheat the oil for deep frying. Start adding a few balls at a time into the oil and fry them on medium heat. The medium heat helps the balushahi to cook evenly from the inside.Once you notice that the dough balls come floating up to the surface flip over and fry until the bottom half is darker golden brown. Remember it is important to fry them on medium heat and not high heat so it gets evenly cooked from the inside.Once both sides are browned well, drain and continue the same with the remaining dough portions and keep them aside.Now let's get the ingredients needed for the sugar syrup. In a sauce pan add in 1/4 cup of water, 1 cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cardamom powder.  With heat on medium, stir the mixture well until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil.Once the mixture comes to a boil, add in the cardamom powder, turn the heat to low and allow the mixture to simmer until you get a single thread consistency.You will know that it has reached the single thread when you touch the sugar syrup between your fingers, you will find it sticky. And when the syrup drips from the spoon it will look a longer drop.We will now dip each of the fried doughs one at a time in the sugar syrup until it gets coated all around and arrange then on a platter. Continue the same with the remaining fried dough.Garnish the Balushahi (Badusha) with pistachios and allow them to rest until the sugar hardens.

Cover and keep the dough aside till we prepare the filling.To make the filling, combine the paneer, oregano and salt. Adjust taste and keep aside.Divide the whole-wheat ravioli dough into 2 equal portions. Roll each half into a very thin rectangular sheet with a rolling pin.Make sure you use enough flour to dust the surface and the dough to roll it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining portion of the two and make two sheets.Once you have rolled the sheets, we need to shape and fill these sheets and shape them into raviolis.To shape ravioli, I use a ravioli tray. This helps to hold the filling and also shape it evenly. Dust the sheets with more flour and place it on the ravioli tray.Lightly press the sheet into the cavities to make a depression for the filling. Spoon a small portion of the filling into the depression. Take care not to over stuff it. Place the other ravioli sheet over this filled sheet.Using the rolling pin press, close and cut the ravioli. You will notice it forms impressions on the edges. When you over turn this, the individual ravioli pieces will comes out.Dust the filled ravioli with a lot more flour and keep it aside till you are ready to use it. You can refrigerate it and make it when you are ready with the sauce.  To make the mushroom sauce, heat oil in a wok over medium heat. Add the garlic and mushrooms and sauté on high heat until you notice the mushrooms begin to soften a little.At this stage, add the milk, Italian oats, chili flakes, salt and herbs.  Add water if required to adjust the consistency of the sauce.Cook until you get a good saucy consistency, something that is not too thick and not too runny.Once cooked through, check the salt and seasonings and turn off the heat.When you are ready to serve the ravioli, bring a large pot of water to boil. Add ravioli pasta and cook for 5 to 8 minutes.You will notice the ravioli pasta pieces rising to the top. Once you notice they rise to the top, allow them to boil for a few more minutes and remove them from the boiling water and place it on a greased tray.To serve, spoon the sauce on a serving bowl or a platter, place the cooked ravioli pasta over the sauce.

        "Instructions": "To begin making Whole Wheat Spaghetti With Avocado Basil Pesto, first cook the spaghetti. Begin by setting a large pot of water, with a little salt and a drizzle of olive oil, on a high flame. Bring the water to a rolling boil. Then, lower the flame and drop the pasta into it. Cook for about 7-8 minutes, or as per the instructions on the package, until the pasta is cooked al-dente.Drain the pasta in a colander, retaining the water in which the spaghetti is cooked, by collecting it in  in a separate bowl. Do not drain the spaghetti completely, so that it does not dry out while you prepare the pesto.Next, prepare the pesto. In a mixer/grinder or food processor, add the basil, avocado, walnuts, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and pulse in bursts of 4-5 seconds until it is disintegrated. Then run the grinder again so it comes together in a smooth paste. If you need to add water to help it run better and turn smooth, add some of the water used to cook the pasta.In a serving bowl or a platter, mix together the cooked spaghetti and pasta. Sprinkle as much salt as is needed and combine. Drizzle a little bit of the water used to cook the pasta to help mix it evenly.Serve the Whole Wheat Spaghetti With Avocado Basil Pesto with a sprig of basil for garnish and a drizzle of olive oil.Since the recipe doesn't use any cheese in the pesto, you can add grated cheddar or parmesan while preparing the pesto or even as a garnish when serving. Serve Whole Wheat Spaghetti With Avocado Basil Pesto along with Spicy Roasted Pumpkin Carrot Soup and Chickpea Orange Salad with Sun Dried Tomatoes for a weeknight dinner.",

Toss the mix together till all the flavors are well combined.For the spicy beans, place a pan on heat, add some oil to it and allow it to get warm.Add the onion, garlic and sauté it for 1-2 minutes until the onions are softened. Then add tomato puree and cook for 5-10 minutes on a medium heat.When the mix begins to bubble, add the cooked kidney beans/rajma along with the water that was used for cooking it. Stir well.Add Chipotle chilli along with Adobo sauce, crushed cumin and salt. If using red chilli flakes instead, add it now.Mix it all up well and cook to make a thick sauce. This may take 5-7 minutes. Turn off the heat and keep it aside.For the sautéed peppers/vegetables, place a pan on heat, add some oil to it and allow it to get warm.Once done add all the chopped peppers (or any other vegetables that you may like) along with the garlic.Sprinkle salt and sauté for 1-2 minutes. Then, add chilli flakes and oregano, toss together and turn off the heat. Keep aside till ready to use.For the roasted corn salsa, char the corn on the stove top or in a preheated oven. Take the kernels off the cob and put it in a bowl.Add in the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly. Keep aside until later use.For the guacamole, prepare the Avocado guacamole but remember that guacamole needs to be eaten fresh, so this is one component that has to be made last, or just before assembling and serving the burrito bowl.To assemble the burrito bowl, if you are preparing one big bowl for your guests, use a fairly deep 8-9” flat bottom bowl or serving dish.A burrito bowl is essentially layered, so begin with the coriander-lime rice. Spread it generously at the base of the bowl.Over it, spoon the spicy beans and spread it around the rice.Next, layer the sauteed peppers over the beans.On top of that goes a layer of guacamole.Spread some corn salsa over it, and top it with the lettuce (if using), cheese and black olives and serve.If you are making individual burrito bowls for a smaller crowd, follow the same sequence of layers, but use smaller sized ramekins for serving.To make a Burrito Bar, simply place all the prepared components on convenient location. Give your guests individual bowls and allow them to choose their favorite toppings to assemble the bowls of their choice.To serve it as a warm winter casserole, once assembled, bake the bowl in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes and serve hot with baked Tortilla chips.Serve the Mexican Vegetarian Burrito Bowl for a wholesome dinner followed by a dessert of Apple Enchiladas.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Mexican Sizzler  recipe, we will firstly begin with the Garlic Pepper Rice.In a heavy bottomed pan, heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil, sauté the garlic well, now add peppers & blanched veggies and give it a mix. Add black pepper, salt and let the bell peppers get a little crispy. Now add the rice and mix once more. Check for salt and spice. Keep aside.The next step is to make the Quinoa Patties. Wash and soak quinoa in warm water for 30 minutes (I felt red quinoa took a little more time to cook). Drain and cook as per packet instructions. Let it cool a bit. Now add in the boiled potato (mashed), onions, spices and seasonings and make a dough kind of mass. Pinch out small roundels and flatten it on greased or wet palms to a thick disc. Roll in cornmeal or roasted suji and clingwrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Shallow fry in the required oil till they are golden brownNext, we will prepare the roasted vegetables for the sizzler. Blanch all veggies except peppers and onions. In a skillet, heat the remaining oil, add the chillies, garlic, peppers and onions and sauté it well. Now add 1 tablespoon of each of the sauces, veggies, salt, paprika and sauté well. Check for salt and seasoningThe final step is to assemble the sizzler. During the last phase of your cooking, place the cast iron sizzling pan directly on the flame. Let it become red hot.Now place the cast iron pan on the wooden casing, arrange the patties, roasted veggies and rice, drop a blob of cold butter when it would sizzle (alternately, you can place the butter directly on the iron plate and then start assembling the cabbage leaves and on top place the three components of the dish).Serve Mexican Sizzler on its own during your house parties and impress your friends and family. You can also serve it along a cocktail like Cucumbertini Recipe (A Refreshing Cucumber Cocktail) or Apple And Ginger Cocktail Recipe.",

Divide the dough into 8 portions and shape them into balls. Preheat the iron skillet on medium high heat.Flatten these balls with the palm of your hand. Take a portion of the dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter.As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Cook the rolled dough as indicated in the steps below. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.We will now pressure cook the Rajma with water for about 3 whistle until done. Switch off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally and add the black eyed peas and masoor and add some more water cook it for about 3 more whistle.  Keep it aside.Heat a sauce pan with oil, add onions and garlic saute them until it softens. Add the pureed tomatoes and cooked beans along with some water, cook for about 5 minutes. Later add spices along with salt and cook until the gravy thickens. Our filling is ready.Our next step is to grill the Quesadillas. Preheat a cast iron skillet while we fill and prepare the quesadillas.Spread butter on one side of the large tortilla. With heat on medium, place the buttered side down on the skillet.Spoon over some 3 beans filling over one-half of the tortilla, leaving about 1/2 an inch space from the edge. Sprinkle some grated cheese over this filling.Fold over the empty half of the tortilla, covering the filling, making a semi-circular quesadilla.Heat this side until the bottom-surface develops deep golden-brown spots and the cheese melts. This would take about 2 to three minutes. Press down the Quesadilla so the cheese melts.Once the bottom has turned golden and crisp, flip the Quesadilla over carefully and allow the other side to brown up. Once done, transfer to the serving plate.Using a pizza cutter or a knife, cut to form triangular portions of the quesadilla.Serve the 3 Beans Stuffed Quesadillas along with tomato salsa, pineapple salsa and a bowl of sour curd to go along with your quesadillas.",

Roll the dough into a ball, cover with a moist muslin cloth and keep aside.The next step is to make the filling. In a kadai or heavy bottomed pan, warm the ghee, add the jeera and allow it to crackle and tip in the chilli paste. Saute these together for a minute.Add peas followed by all the other spices and cook till the pea mixture becomes dry and all the water has dried up. Season with salt and cook again for 2-3 minutes. Set the peas mixture aside to cool down so it is easier to handle when shaping the samosas.Make a flour paste, by combining the flour and water.To begin making the samosa cases, divide the dough into small balls and roll them into thin circles. Cut each rolled-out circle into two halves by running your knife down the center, so you have 2 semi-circles for each disc. Roll the semi-circles into cones and using a teaspoon fill them with the peas mixture.Dab the flour paste along the edges of the open side of the cone, press the two edges together and seal. Arrange the matar samosas in a platter and cover them with a moist muslin cloth.Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai on medium heat. Deep fry the matar samosas in hot oil till they are golden brown. Try not to fry too many together as it will crowd the kadai and alter the cooking time.Remove the Matar Samosa from the kadai using a slotted spoon and drain them on kitchen paper. Matar Samosa  can be served with a dollop of Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and khajoor imli chutney or tomato ketchup, along with masala chai in the evening.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Dahi Bhindi Recipe, we will first roast the Bhindi .Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a Wok or a Kadai; add the chopped onions and the bhindi (okra). Sprinkle some salt and sauté the bhindi and the onions on low heat. Keep the pan covered for the few minutes so the bhindi gets cooked.When covered the bhindi releases moisture, but this moisture helps it to cook and soften as well.Once you notice that it has released a little moisture and the bhindi is slightly softened, open the pan and stir fry the bhindi until it is well roasted. Make sure you roast it on medium heat. Roast the Bhindi until you notice it has begun to shrink and has browned. It should not become sticky, slimy and gooey. If it has turned this way, add a little more oil and sprinkle some gram flour/besan and stir it gently. This will absorb the sliminess.The bhindi is a tricky vegetable to cook, so it takes some practice to not making it gooey.Once the bhindi is cooked and well roasted, keep it aside till we prepare the yogurt gravy.To make the Yogurt Curry, add the yogurt into a saucepan; add the gram flour, grated ginger, garam masala powder,  turmeric powder and chili powder. Whisk until smooth. Add in 1/4 cup of water and whisk again until well combined.Place the saucepan on a medium heat and allow the yogurt mixture to come to a brisk boil. Allow it to boil for a couple of minutes and then turn the heat to low. Simmer the mixture until the yogurt becomes thick and creamy. Once thick and creamy, add in the roasted bhindi and stir. Simmer for a few more minutes. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.Turn off the heat and transfer the Dahi Bhindi a serving bowl. The final step is to make the seasoning. Heat a tablespoon of ghee in a Tadka Pan. Add the cumin seeds, dry red chilies and roast them until lightly browned.Pour this seasoning and the caramelized onions into the Dahi Bhindi. Stir to mix gently and finally stir in the chopped coriander leaves.Serve the Dahi Bhindi along with Phulka Recipe  or Steamed Rice and  Green Moong Sprout Salad for a simple weeknight dinner or even a weekend lunch.",

As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Cook the millet phulka as indicated in the steps below. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.*Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Gas StovePlace rolled dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled dough to the other side on the skillet.After a few seconds turn the flame to high; using tongs take the rolled Millet phulka off the skillet and place it directly on the flame. It should balloon into a spherical shape and puff up.Remove the Millet phulka from heat, place it on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled Millet phulka dough and keep stacking them one over the other.*Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Electric StoveThis process can be used if you are using a gas stove as well.Preheat an iron skillet. Place rolled Millet phulka dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled Millet phulka dough to the other side on the skillet.Flip over again and cook the first side pressing lightly with a napkin. The rolled out phulka dough should begin to start puffing out.Flip and cook the other side for a few more seconds.Remove from the heat, place the Millet phulka on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up. Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled dough and keep stacking them the phulka one over the other.Serve the Mixed Millet Phulka Recipe with Spinach Paneer Kofta Curry and Dangar Pachadi With Grated Carrots to create complete healthy meal.TipMaking the rolled out phulka dough puff into a balloon comes with practice. So give yourself time if you are new to bread making.Even if yours does not puff the first time or the times after, the rotis that you have made are cooked and are edible, so you could consume them with your choice of vegetables.Using thinner rolling pins is the key, as you want to be gentle with the dough.The heavy big ones will make you press harder which might just make it tear. It’s well worth investing in a thinner rolling pin and tongs to hold the bread which is available in most Indian stores around the world.Tossing the phulka dough in flour as you roll is another helper that will make the rolling out the dough easier.",

After 2 hours, knead once again and divide the dough into equal portions.Preheat the iron griddle on medium high heat.Roll the portions of dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.Take a portion of the dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into oval shape.As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.After the first roll of the dough ball, sprinkle some garlic on the surface of the dough , lightly press it down and begin to roll it again.Once you got a nice oval shaped naan of medium thickness, transfer it on the hot griddle. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes.Then flip the Jowar Garlic Naan  and smear about 1/2 a teaspoon of ghee. Using a flat spatula do a light pressing and turning motion to cook to the naan.Flip to the other side and press and turn the naan in a similar way, smear ghee once again.

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe, we will first need to make the dough for the parathas. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 14 to 16 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you the feeling ready.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. I am going to be using homemade paneer as it makes the parathas softer, but you can use store bought paneer as well.In a large bowl; add in the homemade paneer. Use your fingers or a fork and begin to crumble the cottage cheese. Next add in 1 large chopped onion, lots of chopped methi leaves, finely chopped green chillies, cumin powder, and salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 10 to 12 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha. Once sealed press down the paneer paratha with your palms to release any air pockets. And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a paneer methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the paneer paratha.Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the paneer parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the paneer paratha is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the remaining dough portions the same way.Serve the Stuffed Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe along with a Raita for a wholesome breakfast or dinner.",

Stuffing for palak kachori is ready.The next step is to make the Kachori. Divide the kachori dough to small lemon size balls.Dust and roll out each ball lightly into thick circular puri. Don't make it thin.Put 1-2 teaspoons stuffing mixture in the center of puri, bring its ends together and seal its edges nicely. Slightly press with hand or roll lightly to flatten the stuffed balls . Heat oil over medium flame to deep fry kachori. When the oil is just hot, slide the kachoris in the pan. Cook on low heat till lightly browned from both the sides. Remove the kachori on a tissue paper to absorb the excess oil from the kachoris. Once it is done, serve it hot.Serve this mouth watering Palak And Peas Kachori along with Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and Date Tamarind Chutney for tea time snacks or as evening snacks. You can also serve these Kachoris with palak peas filling for your potluck or as an starter for your house parties.",

Add yeast, salt, sugar, garlic powder or chopped garlic and stir to combine all the ingredients.Add the lukewarm water little at a time and knead to make a soft and smooth dough. Knead well for about 5 minutes so the dough becomes light and fluffy.Cover the dough and set it to rise in a warm place for a couple of hours or until it is doubled.Once the dough has risen or close to its ready time, we will prepare the stuffing for the Kulchas.Into a food processor add onion, mint, coriander, garlic and process to fine chop. If you are not using any food processor then make sure to fine chop all the four ingredients. Once the dough gets doubled in size bring it out and ounch it with your fingers to release the trapped air. To make kulchas, heat iron skillet over medium heat, pinch out a small portion from the dough and shape it into a round. Roll out the ball into a circle of approx 2 inch diameter. Spoon a tablespoon of filling into the center. Bring the corners of the dough to the centre to seal the Kulcha dough. Once again gently flatten the ball with light pressure of your palm. Dust lightly on flour and roll it out into a circle without putting too much pressure on the kulcha else filling will ooze out from the sides. Transfer the rolled out Kulcha dough to the hot skillet. Cook on both the sides until you see it starts puffing up. Once it does, transfer it to direct heat to puff up the Kulchas.  While cooking over the direct heat make sure to flip the kulcha continuously to cook evenly from all sides. While cooking over the direct heat make sure to flip the kulcha continuously to cook evenly from all sides.  Proceed the same way with the remaining dough and fillingServe the Whole Wheat Onion Kulcha's along with Chole Pindi Recipe, or Amritsari Chole Recipe and Palak raita.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Healthy Veg Lollipop Recipe With Palak & Rajma, soak rajma in water for 7-8 hours or overnight. The quantity of rajma would have almost doubled.Drain the water and pressure cook the soaked rajma with fresh water upto 8 to 10 whistles/ about 30 minutes so that they are soft when pressed. Let the pressure release on its own.Drain the water from the rajma and use it for any other purpose (in a curry or to knead chapati dough). Do not discard this water.In the meantime, thoroughly wash palak leaves multiple times. Saute the spinach lighty in a pan without any oil until soft and the spinach shrinks. Turn off the heat and allow the spinach to cool.Now, finely powder rolled oats in a mixer/blender and set aside.In a mixing bowl, take cooked rajma and mash it well using a masher or with your hand. Do not make it completely smooth, but coarsely mash some of them. This will give you a nice texture when you bite the lollipops.Next, add the cooked spinach, oats powder, salt and all the spices mentioned under 'To make Palak Rajma Oats Lollipop' which includes red chilli powder, garam masala powder, cumin powder, amchur powder, salt and oil.Mix all the contents thoroughly so that it forms a soft non-sticky dough. You should be easily able to shape it into small balls. If your dough is sticky, you can add more oats powder. Make small lemon sized balls and set aside.Check the spices and salt and adjust to suit your taste.Now, you will have to make a thin paste of gram flour. For this, mix gram flour with salt and turmeric powder. Add water as required and whisk well to form a lump-free, thin paste. Set aside.Next, make a coarse powder of rolled oats and set aside. Coating the veg lollipops with oats gives a nice crunchy texture to them. Now, heat a paddu / appe / paniyaram pan and add few drops of oil to each of the cavities.Dip each of the veg lollipop balls in gram flour mixture and roll them gently over oats so that they are uniformly coated.Gently place the veg lollipop balls inside the oiled cavities of the paddu pan.

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Tofu Methi Paratha Recipe, we will first make the dough for the parathas. In a large bowl add whole wheat flour and some salt. Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 6 equal portions and keep aside.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. In a large bowl; add tofu, onion, chopped methi leaves, green chillies, cumin powder, and salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 6 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place a portion of the tofu methi paratha filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the tofu methi paratha. Once sealed press down the tofu methi paratha with your palms to release any air pockets.And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a tofu methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the tofu methi paratha.Flip again, so the oiled side of the tofu methi paratha can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the tofu methi paratha while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the tofu methi paratha to get a crisp on the outside and yet have soft texture.Once the tofu methi paratha is cooked transfer it to a plate and serve.Serve the Tofu Methi Paratha Recipe along with a Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita Recipe and Pisarna Manga Recipe  for breakfast, lunch or dinner.",

You can do this in a blender as well, but the dough when worked with hands gives a better texture to the dough.Stir together the warm water, yeast  and sugar until yeast is completely dissolved. Now make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the yogurt, salt and yeast mixture.Knead into the flour and until the whole dough collects into a mass. Add a little more water if required to bring the dough together. The dough will be wet and sticky. Wipe your hands clean and oil them. Now knead the naan dough with the oiled hands until smooth , for about 10 minutes; oil your hands more if the dough is sticky. The dough after 10 minutes of kneading will still be soft and pliable. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover the bowl and  allow the dough to rest for 3 to 4 hours until the dough has doubled in volume. Once the naan dough has doubled, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into 12 to 15 equal portions.With a rolling pin, quickly roll out each ball into a 5 inch oval. With your fingers, stretch each round into a 5-7 inch oval. The next step is to cook the naans. Follow either of the below methods.Method for Cooking the Naans in the OvenPreheat the oven to 250 C or to the maximum heat.If you have a baking stone; place it in the oven. Arrange a few of the naans in a single layer on the ungreased baking sheets or directly on the baking stone. And bake until they are puffed and lightly brown, 3-4 minutes.Repeat with the same process of baking with the remaining naans. Keep the baked naans aside. Naans can be pre made and kept warm wrapped in a cloth and inside bread box or any other covered container.Before serving, preheat broiler to maximum heat. Transfer a few of the naans to the broiler pan and broil for 15-20 seconds to brown the tops.You can also brown the tops on the gas stove; hold the naans with the tongs and place them directly over the flame for about 10 seconds. Repeat with remaining breads.Method for Cooking the Naans on Gas StoveHeat an iron skillet on high heat. Place the rolled naans out on the skillet and cook on both sides until you can see light brown spots and bubbles coming through. Using tongs, flip the naan directly on the flame to give it the roasted flavor and make it little more crisp.Once done, remove from the flame and serve hot.Brush the tops of the Butter Naan lightly with chaat masala and butter if desired. Serve the Butter Naans hot.Serve Homemade Butter Naan recipe with Paneer Makhani or Smoked Dal Makhani Dhaba Style Recipe and Pickled Onions for a weekend lunch or dinner.",

For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it is reduced to about more than half of its quantity stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Finally stir in the cardamom powder, saffron and chopped pistachios into the Kulfi milk mixture.Turn off the heat and allow the kesar pista kulfi mixture to cool completely. Pour the kesar pista kulfi mixture in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator. The Kesar Pista Kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.  If you get wooden ice cream sticks in the market, you can insert them in and freeze the Kulfis.Once frozen you can run the kesar pista kulfi moulds under water to enable easy release onto the plate and serve.Serve the Kesar Pista Kulfi for your Holi or Diwali Party or when you have an elaborate Indian Dinner Menu planned for your parties.

This process will take a good 20 minutes. Ensure the milk is stirred occasionally to prevent the bottom of the pan burning the milk. It is also always a good idea to keep a ladle inside the milk container. Once the milk is reduced, add the cardamom powder, and a few strands of saffron. Next, to this add the gulkand and mix vigorously until it melts and comes together along with the milk. Adjust the sweetness of the gulkand kheer, based on the sweetness of the gulkand, if required add sugar to suit your taste. Since the gulkand is already packed with the rose flavour, depending on how strong or mild you prefer, add the rose water, according to how aromatic you like the gulkand kheer to be. Finally, add in the thin seviyan and wait until the seviyan wilts down and becomes soft. Turn off the heat, transfer the Gulkand kheer to a serving bowl and garnish with some crushed pistachios and dry rose petals. Serve Gulkand Seviyan Kheer as dessert or part of a meal that consists of Ajwain Puri Recipe, and Aloo Tamatari Recipe for a lovely comforting Sunday brunch.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making Mawa Gujiya Recipe, add saffron to warm milk in a bowl. Set it aside for 15 minutes.The next step is to make the filling for Gujiya. Crumble or grate the khoya/mawa. In a thick bottom pan add the khoya/mawa and roast it on low flame till it changes colour to light brown (approximately 25 minutes or so). Next, add desiccated coconut and roast further for 2 minutes. Add almonds and pistachios to the khoya/mawa, mix well, remove from the heat and keep aside. When the roasted khoya/mawa is still warm, add sugar and mix it well. Set it aside. Be careful towards the end of the roasting process so that the khoya/mawa does not turn too dry. It should be moist yet a little brownish in colour)Next, we will prepare the dough for Gujiya. While you wait for the khoya/mawa to cool, make the dough. In a bowl, mix together maida, semolina, sugar and baking soda. Add ghee and start rubbing the flour mix with the tip of your fingers.Add water gradually and as much as required to make medium soft dough. Knead the dough for 2 minutes until smooth.Divide the mawa gujiya dough in two parts and make two neat balls. Set aside for half an hour covered with a moist cloth so that the dough does not dry out.Finally, we will stuff the Mawa in Gujiya. Preheat the oven at 180 degrees C.Thinly roll one ball and use a cookie cutter to cut out dough in the desired shape. Gujiyas are usually semi circle but you can also use a cookie cutter for different shapes.Roll the dough in a rectangular shape. Trim the edges. Cut it lengthwise wide enough to to place the mawa filling. Cut these rectangular strips further to a squares of equal size.  Line two baking trays with parchment paper. Place each cut out square dough on the baking tray at an inch distance.Scoop one heaped teaspoon of cooled mawa filling in the centre of each square dough and cover with another layer of square dough cut out.Seal the sides of the mawa gujiya all around by pressing the edges with a fork.Repeat this process till all the gujiya dough is used and filled. Brush the top of the gujiya with milk or beaten egg and sprinkle flaked almonds.Bake in the oven for approximately 15 minutes or till it begins to just turn golden brown. Remove from the oven and let them cool over a wire rack. Alternatively, you can also prepare the square gujiyas with the filling and deep fry the gujiyas in oil.Once the mawa gujiya is baked or fried, keep them aside.To make the sugar syrup, add water to a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Once the water has boiled, lower the heat, add the sugar and stir continuously. Once the sugar has melted completely, add the saffron mixture, give it a good stir for a minute and turn off the heat. While the Mawa Gujiyas are warm, brush them with the saffron sugar syrup or you can even dip them in it. Once the Mawa Gujiyas are completely cooled down, the syrup will add a nice glaze to them.Serve these Mawa Gujiyas during Holi or Diwali along with a glass of Thandai and with a delicious plate of Dahi Vada.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making the Smoked Dhaba Dal Recipe; we will use the pressure cooker method to make the dal in one pot along with all the spices.Soak the tuvar dal and green moong dal for about an hour in water. Once you are through with the soaking time, get all the ingredients ready.Heat a teaspoon of oil in the pressure cooker; add the onions, ginger, garlic and green chillies and saute for a few minutes until the onions are lightly tender and softened. Add the tomatoes, and the remaining spices and saute until you smell the aromas coming through.Add the soaked dals, salt and add 3 cups of water. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and cook until you hear 2 to 3 whistles. After two to three whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer the Dhaba Dal for about 5 to 8 minutes. Once done, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.The dal continues to cook under the pressure, hence we allow it to rest until the pressure releases.Once the pressure releases; open the cooker and you will notice the dal cooked and mushy. That is how we want the Dhaba Dal to appear. Stir in the chopped coriander leaves and check the salt and spice levels. Adjust to suit your taste. Adjust the consistency of the dal, by adding water.Now the final step is to add the smoked flavor and to prepare the seasoning.To smoke the dal heat charcoal until red hot over the gas burner (direct flame). Once the coal is red hot, place it in a heatproof bowl.Place this bowl on top of the cooked lentils. Drizzle a teaspoon of ghee over the hot coal. The coal will begin to smoke almost instantly. At this stage, cover the dal pan and allow the smoke to circulate inside. This process of smoking a dal, is called Dhungar or Coal Smoking Technique.After about a minute, open the dal pan and you will see the smoke effect has withered. Transfer the Smoked Dhaba Dal to a serving bowl.For the seasoning; heat a teaspoon of ghee in a small pan; add the cumin seeds, the slivered garlic, and red chillies. Allow the cumin to crackle for a few seconds and turn off the heat. Pour this seasoning over the Smoked Dhaba Dal.Serve Smoked Dhaba Dal Recipe along with Garlic Naan and Palak Raita for a weekday meal.",

Stir continuously until they lightly brown and you get a roasted aroma.Once the lentils are roasted, we will add in the cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, dry red chillies, fenugreek seeds and the coriander seeds. Turn the heat to low and roast well until the chillies begin to brown and you get a roasted aroma from the spices.Next will add in the poppy seeds and coconut. Continue to roast along with other ingredients for about a 30 to 40 seconds until the coconut loses its moisture. Once it is roasted we will add in the turmeric powder and the asafoetida powder. Stir until it combines well into the other ingredients. Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool completely.Once cooled add the ingredients to a spice blender and make a fine powder of the mixture. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and keep aside.Next thing to do, is to make the spicy vegetable tamarind sambar.For this, in a large pressure cooker, we will add the tamarind water, jaggery, the drumsticks, pearl onions, beans, carrots, bell peppers, tomatoes, salt and finally the bisi bele bhaat spice powder.Stir all the ingredients well. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight and allow the vegetables to cook until you hear at least 2 whistles and turn off the heat. Since the vegetables cook very quickly, we will release the pressure by running cold water over the pressure cooker. This process helps to bring the pressure down immediately.Open the pressure cooker and smell the aroma from the vegetable curry. You can transfer this to another bowl to reuse the pressure cooker for the next process. But since I have another pressure cooker, I will leave it aside as it is.Now lets get the main ingredients to make the Bisi Bele Bath and learn how to bring them all togetherTo the pressure cooked at in the washed rice, the washed lentils, the turmeric powder, salt and 5 cups of water. Cover the cooker and place the weight on the pressure cooker. Turn the heat to high and allow the rice to cook until you hear two whistles.After you hear the whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for five minutes. After 5 minutes have passed, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally. Rice cooks in this resting period, hence wait for the pressure to release completely.While we are waiting for the pressure to release, Lets proceed to make the seasoning.For seasoning the Bisi Bele Bath, heat a small pan on medium heat. Add in a tablespoon of ghee and allow it to melt. Add in the mustard seeds, the cumin seeds. Allow it to crackle. Then add in the red chilli, curry leaves and roast them until the red chillies are browned lightly. Stir to roast the ingredients well. Once roasted keep this aside.Now we will get back to the rice and dal pressure cooker. Once the pressure is released , open the pressure cooker. Add in the spicy vegetable tamarind curry. Stir all the ingredients together until well combined and the mixture looks like a mish mash. At this stage add in the prepared seasoning and two more tablespoons of ghee. Once again give the mixture a good stir.Transfer the Bisi Bele Bath to a serving bowl.

        "Instructions": "To begin making soft homemade idli, we will first make the idli batter. Soak the rice in water, such that the all the rice is completely immersed in water. Let it soak for about 6 hours.Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water. Let it soak for about 6 hours.First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy. Pour this batter into a large container.Grind the rice into a smooth paste, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the dosa batter too watery. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .The rice batter is a little coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.To make the idlisGrease the idli molds with a little sesame oil. This process is purely optional. I like to do this as it adds to the flavor of the idli’s. Pour spoonfuls of the batter into these moulds.Do make sure you fill the idli batter only half way through as they will rise up to the top when steamed. Once all the plates are filled, place the filled idli racks one above the other making sure the holes are facing the filled portion.Prepare the idli steamer with a little water in the bottom. Place the filled idli racks in the steamer. Place the steamer on high heat and steam the idli’s for 10 minutes.After 10 minutes of steaming, turn off the heat. Open the steamer and insert a knife or a pick to test whether the idli's are cooked. If nothing sticks then the idlis are perfectly steamed.Now you can remove the idli’s from the steamer. Have a small bowl filled with water. Dip a spoon in the water and then scoop the idli's out starting from the edges. Dipping the spoon in water helps in the easy removal of idli from the plates.The wholesome homemade soft idli are now ready to be served for breakfast, lunch or dinner.Serve Classic Homemade Soft Idli with Coconut Chutney, Thakkali Vengayam Sambar, Idli Milagai Podi & Filter Coffee for a delicious breakfast at home.",

        "Instructions": "To begin preparing the Spicy Sweet Corn & Oat Fritters Recipe, get all the ingredients under the section “To grind”. Add it to a mixer and grind to make a coarse mixture of the corn, green chillies, ginger and cumin seeds. Transfer the ground mixture into a large mixing bowl. Add the remaining ingredients into the bowl along with ground sweet corn mixture. Combine all of it well and get a thick consistency to make the vada.  Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.Note: add the powdered oats little by little, until you get the required consistency. The mixture should be fairly thick so that it holds well when fritters are formed. At this stage the consistency is critical. If not thick enough, the fritters will absorb too much oil while deep-frying. If you feel the mixture is not thick enough, you can add a tablespoon of rice flour or chickpea flour (besan) to bind it.Method to Deep fry The Sweet Corn VadasTo form the fritters or vadas, take a tablespoon of the mixture at a time, about the size of a small lemon. Flatten it on wet palm to make a patty or fritter and place it on a platter or plate. Repeat, until all the mixture is used.You can refrigerate the vadas for 15 minutes. This allows them to dry out and firm up a little before deep-frying. This is an optional step, and if your mixture is firm enough the vadas may be fried directly without refrigeration.Heat oil for deep frying, in a kadhai, over a high heat. When hot enough, reduce the heat and slowly slide the patties into the oil. Fry them on both sides till they are a golden.Remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon, drain the Sweet Corn Vadas on paper towels to remove the excess oil and serve the sweet corn vadas hot.Method to Bake the Sweet Corn VadasTo bake the fritters, first preheat the oven at 200 degrees celsius for 15-20 minutes.Spread a baking sheet or parchment paper on the baking tray.Lightly grease your palms with oil so as to handle the mixture more easily and shape the fritters. Take a tablespoon of mixture at a time, about the size of a small lemon.Flatten it on your palm to make a patty or fritter and place it on the baking sheet. Repeat, until all the mixture is used, and lay the fritters in rows about an inch apart.Brush the fritters a little oil. Slide the baking tray into the oven and bake at 200 degrees celsius for 15 to 18 minutes turning the fritters over half way through so they brown evenly on both the sides.For a crisp topping, now turn the oven mode to broil and let them bake for another minute or two until crisp. Once done remove the Sweet Corn & Oats Masala Vadas from the oven and serve hot.Serve the Sweet Corn & Oats Masala Vadas hot with Masala Chai for a great monsoon tea time treat.",

        "Instructions": "To begin making high protein soya idli, we will first make the idli batter. Soak the rice in water, such that the all the rice is completely immersed in water. Let it soak for about 6 hours.Soak the soya bean in water, such that the all the soya bean is completely immersed in water and the water is at least 2 inches above as the soya will absorb water and fluff up. Let it soak for about 6 hours.Soak the urad dal, methi seeds and chana dal in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water. Let it soak for about 6 hours.First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy. Pour this batter into a large container.Next grind the soya bean into a fine smooth batter. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy. Pour this batter into the urad dal.Grind the rice into a smooth paste, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the dosa batter too watery. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .The rice batter is a little coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.Combine the urad , soya bean and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.To make the soya idlisGrease the idli molds with a little sesame oil or ghee. This process is purely optional. I like to do this as it adds to the flavor of the idli’s. Pour spoonfuls of the batter into these moulds.Do make sure you fill the soya idli batter only half way through as they will rise up to the top when steamed. Once all the plates are filled, place the filled soya idli racks one above the other making sure the holes are facing the filled portion.Prepare the idli steamer with a little water in the bottom. Place the filled soya idli racks in the steamer. Place the steamer on high heat and steam the idli’s for 10 minutes.After 10 minutes of steaming, turn off the heat. Open the steamer and insert a knife or a pick to test whether the soya idli are cooked. If nothing sticks then the soya idlis are perfectly steamed.Now you can remove the soya idlis from the steamer. Have a small bowl filled with water. Dip a spoon in the water and then scoop the soya idli out starting from the edges. Dipping the spoon in water helps in the easy removal of idli from the plates.The wholesome high protein soft soya idli are now ready to be served for breakfast, lunch or dinner.Serve High Protein Soya Idli Recipe with Coconut Chutney, Tomato Onion Chutney, Thakkali Vengayam Sambar, Idli Milagai Podi & Filter Coffee for a delicious breakfast at home.",
